		Independent Project<br><br>

			<input type="button" id="btnValidate" value="Validate Email" onclick = "ValidateEmail()" />
		</form><br>

		For my independent project, I would like to create a magic eight ball.  
		It will be a website that will be of mostly vector images.  When the 
		user clicks on the magic eight ball, the ball will shake and the 
		appropriate responses of a magic eight ball will appear.  
		I hope to implement something that will allow the user to customize 
		the color scheme of the magic eight ball as well.  I am also 
		thinking of adding a background (comprised colorful vector images)
		 to make the website look like an office of somesort.<br><br>

		However, if that seems too simple, which I'm afraid it might be, perhaps 
		I could make a how-to website.  Since I'm currently watching the 
		Australian Open, I could make a website explaining how-to play tennis.

		Main User and Goals<br>
		User: Someone who is unable to make a decision or wants to leave their decisions up to fate.<br>
		Goals: To be able to help someone make a decision using a magic eight ball without physically having a magic eight ball.<br>
