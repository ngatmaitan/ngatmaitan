For my independent project, I would like to create a magic eight ball.  
It will be a website that will be of mostly graphical images (2D 
vectors).  When the user clicks on the magic eight ball, the ball will 
shake and the appropriate responses of a magic eight ball will appear.  
I hope to implement something that will allow to the user to customize 
the color scheme of the magic eight ball as well.</br></br>

However, if that seems to simple, which I'm afraid it might be, perhaps 
I could make a how-to website.  Since I'm currently watching the 
Australian Open, I could make a website explaining how-to play tennis.
